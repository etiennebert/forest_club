GLORIA Data Usage Guide
Dataset Reference
The GLORIA (Global Resource Input-Output Assessment) database is a Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) database developed using the IELab infrastructure by the University of Sydney for the UN International Resource Panel (UN IRP). The database was created as part of the update of material footprint accounts within the UN IRP Material Flows Database.

To enhance synergies between different UNEP initiatives, GLORIA was also selected as the underlying MRIO model for the Sustainable Consumption and Production Hotspots Analysis Tool (SCP-HAT).
